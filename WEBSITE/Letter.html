<p> I don't know if you like reading long letters from someone, but we send letters every anniversary right?
    Im currently writing this in September 22, im sleep deprived and im still working on multiple school projects atm
:pppppp im awaiting some critique content for me to start the powerpoint presentation krrbeghehbgebhg. First off,
I want to greet you a happy birthday :3. I wish you a very long and prosperous life. 
And i hope my 3 gifts for you is enough for you to be happy :). This entire website gimmick
took me about almost 3 hours to code. Sorry if its not as pleasing since my coding knowledge is very rusty right now. I pulled up some personal
    pointers for myself to try to refresh my mind hahahahhaah. And do you also know what day is it today???? It's our 3RD MONTH TOGETHER!!
Can you believe its been 3 months???? I can't even believe myself aswell. As im writing this, im currently tearing up
while listening to a "Werid Al" Yankovic track on spotify. I know our past month has been extremely rough.
Im in constant jealousy because of Sachin. He constantly gives you gifts, and im just worried 
i might lose you because he also has attachment issues. You try your hardest to try to reassure me, but i am 
too stubborn to accept reality. I never heard you out since you would focus on me even more less as 
the days would go on. Atleast, from my point of view. I looked up multiple sites on how to ease this feeling 
im having right now, but each threads just give me that feeling that im being selfish or controlling
or anything like that. Which hurts me even more. Cause i DONT want to control your social life. 
I want you to have friends. I really do. But i miss the times where we would chat all day (not all the time) but back
to the days lets say while i was in Cebu. I am extremely dependent to you. And seeing you just occasionally chatting me in favor
to also chat with Sachin to try to balance everything out, my selfishness just got the better of me and i started to overthink for the worse.
But, i can't do anything about it right? Whenever we would talk about this, and you would wish that you shouldn't have chatted with him,
i started to beat myself up for it because if the both of you would stop chatting, i would be at fault, because of my own selfishness. I'm just jealous about how you're having 
a time of your life with him. Performing with him at a wedding. And i remember seeing that picture of you both doing that heart pose in the photos. And all you can talk about to me is how 
you had a really great time with him. I'm very happy for you, i really am. But im not happy at myself for not giving you that level of fun and happiness just like what he's giving to you.
I know he also made a website for you, but i have also been planning to code you a website for a while so it kinda broke me when you got all excited when you knew 
he's making you a website.
I also can't say that i would have a good social life, outside of the screen. Sure, i may have a few friends whom i would talk occasionally,
but it is you i would look forward to talk to, since you're very fun to talk to, you'd keep me company all day back then. You'd 
say silly stuff and would make me feel like i matter and i love you for that. But everything that i thought about that made you think that you or Sachin were the problem,
you weren't the problem. Im just extremely insecure about myself. As im writing this letter, we didn't greet each other good night, i figured you're mad at me 
for treating you like that earlier. I'm very sorry about that. I know you couldn't split your body to satisfy both parties. Im actually crying while writing this. 
If you played the audio clip, it's actually just an audio clip of "Seaside Rendezvous" by Queen. That's what im listening aswell as im writing and coding this... on loop. 
It's our song, the song that we mutually loved. I just miss you everyday. Please don't start to blame yourself because im like This, 
because i'm always like this. This is a problem only i can stress about, not you. 
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for being a bad boyfriend sometimes <br>
I'm sorry for the way that i act <br>
I'm sorry for my selfishness <br>
I'm sorry for ever making you doubt <br>
I'm sorry if i ever made you cry because of my words <br>
I'm sorry for the attitudes i give off <br>
I'm sorry for being a red flag. <br>
<br>
I just love you so much, that's all. But you have a real life outside of the internet, and i don't most of the time. 
Happy 3rd Monthsary my loves. I will accept it if you don't forgive me for all of my flaws, and ALL of my flaws. 
Cause everytime i try to assure that i want to change for you, im lying to you and to myself. I'm just a compulsive liar.
I just want to let it out, I'm very sorry for all of this emotion and thought on your special day. 

I hope you have a great 14th birthday, and happy 3 months, my demon. :3 I love you so much.

I love you so much, i just don't want to lose you. Please accept this digital boquet of flowers
